# REACT NOTES 

## What is React.JS?

* React.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and has been widely adopted by the web development community for its simplicity, speed, and flexibility.

* In a nutshell, React allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be combined to form complex user interfaces. Each component encapsulates its own logic and state, making it easier to reason about the behavior of the application.

* React is based on a concept called the **virtual DOM**, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). When a user interacts with a React component, the virtual DOM is updated to reflect the changes, and then React efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM to reflect those changes. This results in better performance and a smoother user experience.

* React also uses a declarative programming model, meaning that you describe what you want your UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM accordingly. This is in contrast to an imperative programming model, where you have to manually manipulate the DOM to achieve the desired result.

* Finally, React can be used with other popular front-end libraries and frameworks, such as Redux for managing state and React Router for routing. It also has a large and active community, which provides helpful resources and support for developers.

# React features

## 1. React: The Virtual Dom
### DOM: 
DOM stands for Document Object Model. 
Normally, whenever a user requests a webpage, the browser receives an HTML document for that page from the server. The browser then constructs a logical, tree-like structure from the HTML to show the user the requested page in the client.

This tree-like structure is called the Document Object Model, also known as the DOM. It is a structural representation of the web document as nodes and objects, in this case, an HTML document.

![Alt text](dom.jpg)

### The problem with Dom

> DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern, interactive web. Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most JavaScript operations.
> This slowness is made worse by the fact that most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to.

## Virtual Dom 

* React contains a lightweight representation of real DOM in the memory called Virtual DOM.  
* DOM gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time, Whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time.
* Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click, then the changes will not directly go to Real Dom.
* So, we are having two virtual doms, one VDOM gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real DOM.
* Another VDOM is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values.
* Now these two virtual DOMs will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes this complete procedure is known as **`diffing algorithm.`**
* Now the new changes will be updated in your Real DOM, this procedure is known as **`Recoinciliation`**
This makes a big difference! React can update only the necessary parts of the DOM. React’s reputation for performance comes largely from this innovation.

In summary, here’s what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

1. he entire virtual DOM gets updated.
2. The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
3. The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
4. Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.

## 2. SPA
 * A single-page application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the application. In a traditional web application, clicking on a link or submitting a form would typically result in a request to the server, which would respond with a new HTML page to be rendered in the browser. In contrast, a SPA loads all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files upfront and then communicates with the server in the background to fetch or update data as needed.

* React is a popular JavaScript library for building SPAs. React allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces. React components are declarative, meaning they describe what should be rendered on the page rather than how it should be rendered. This makes it easier to reason about the code and to make changes without introducing bugs.

* In a React SPA, the initial HTML page typically only contains a single "div" element, which serves as the entry point for the React application. When the page loads, React renders the initial UI based on the state of the application. As the user interacts with the application, React updates the UI in response to events such as button clicks or form submissions.

* To handle server requests, a React SPA typically uses an API (Application Programming Interface) to communicate with the server. The API provides a set of endpoints that the client-side code can use to fetch or update data. The client-side code sends requests to the server using the Fetch API or other libraries such as Axios or jQuery. When the server responds, the client-side code updates the state of the application and rerenders the UI as needed.

> One advantage of using a React SPA is that it can provide a smoother and more responsive user experience compared to traditional web applications, since the page does not need to reload every time the user interacts with it. However, SPAs can be more complex to build and maintain, since they require more client-side code and may require additional server-side infrastructure to support the API.

## 3. JSX and Babel
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript code. It was developed by Facebook as part of the React library and is used extensively in React applications.

With JSX, developers can write code that looks like HTML, but is actually a combination of JavaScript and HTML. For example, instead of creating a DOM element using plain JavaScript like this:

```javascript

const element = document.createElement('div');
element.innerText = 'Hello, world!';
```
In JSX, the same code can be written as:

```javascript
const element = <div>Hello, world!</div>;
```
> JSX is not a separate language, but a syntax extension that is transformed into plain JavaScript by a compiler such as **Babel.**
### Babel:
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use modern JavaScript syntax and features while still supporting older browsers that do not support these features. Babel can compile JSX code into plain JavaScript code that can be run in any modern web browser.

In addition to transforming JSX code, Babel can also transform other modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, template literals, and classes into code that can run in older browsers. Babel does this by analyzing the code and replacing any unsupported features with equivalent code that can be run by older browsers.

Overall, JSX and Babel are important tools in the React ecosystem, allowing developers to write modern, expressive code that can be run on a wide range of web browsers.

## 4. One Way Binding
* One-way data binding is a data flow mechanism in which the data flows only in one direction, from the data source to the UI element. This means that when the data changes, the UI element that is bound to the data is automatically updated to reflect the new data, but the reverse is not true.

* In one-way data binding, changes made to the UI element do not update the data source. If the user changes a value in the UI, the change is not automatically propagated back to the data source. Instead, the developer must explicitly update the data source based on the new value in the UI.
> One advantage of one-way data binding is that it can simplify the code and reduce the risk of unintended consequences. Since the data flow is unidirectional, it is easier to reason about the code and to track the source of changes. Additionally, one-way data binding can improve performance by reducing the number of updates that need to be made to the UI.

Example: 

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times.</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
This is an example of one-way data binding, as the value of count flows from the state variable to the UI element (the paragraph element), but changes made to the UI element do not affect the state variable.

If we were using two-way data binding, we would need to define an event handler for the paragraph element to update the state variable when the user changes the text. However, in one-way data binding, the paragraph element is only used to display the current value of the 'count' variable, and does not update the variable when clicked or changed.

## 5. Component based
* Component-based architecture: React allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them down into small, reusable components. Each component is responsible for rendering a small part of the UI, and can be composed together to create larger, more complex UIs.
* There are two types of components in React 
1. Class based components
2. Functional based components

## 6. Named export and default export
A named export allows you to export multiple values from a module, and each of those values can be imported individually by their name. A default export, on the other hand, allows you to export a single value from a module, and that value can be imported using any name.

Here's an example of a module with named exports:

```javascript
// math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
```
In this example, the math.js module exports two functions: add and subtract. These functions can be imported individually like this:

```javascript
import { add, subtract } from './math.js';
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(subtract(5, 2)); // Output: 3
```
> Note that when importing named exports, you need to use the curly braces and specify the names of the exports you want to import.

Now, let's take a look at an example of a module with a default export:

```javascript
// greeting.js
const greeting = name => `Hello, ${name}!`;
export default greeting;
```
In this example, the greeting.js module exports a single function called greeting. This function can be imported using any name like this:

```javascript
import sayHello from './greeting.js';
console.log(sayHello('John')); // Output: Hello, John!
```
> Note that when importing a default export, you don't need to use curly braces and can specify any name for the import.

In summary, named exports allow you to export multiple values from a module, and default exports allow you to export a single value from a module.

## 7. Community support
React has a significant advantage of community support, which is one of the reasons for its popularity among developers. The React community is very active and passionate about the technology, and there are many resources available to help developers learn and solve problems.

Here are some ways in which the React community provides support:

*Documentation*: React has comprehensive documentation that is regularly updated with new features and changes. The documentation is clear and easy to follow, making it an excellent resource for both beginners and experienced developers.

*Online forums and communities*: There are many online forums and communities where developers can ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss best practices related to React. These communities include Stack Overflow, Reddit, GitHub, and more.

*Third-party libraries and tools*: The React community has created many third-party libraries and tools that can help developers work more efficiently with React. These include libraries for state management, routing, styling, testing, and more.

*Conferences and meetups*: There are many conferences and meetups dedicated to React, where developers can attend talks, workshops, and networking events. These events provide an opportunity to learn from experts in the field and connect with other developers.

*Open-source contributions*: React is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to its development. The React community has a strong culture of open-source contributions, and many developers have contributed code, bug fixes, and documentation to the project.

## 8. Web and Mobile 
React is effective for both web and mobile development because it allows developers to write reusable code that can be shared between different platforms.

React Native, a mobile framework built on top of React, allows developers to write mobile applications using the same programming language and development concepts as web applications. This makes it easier for developers to transition between web and mobile development, and to build applications that work seamlessly across both platforms.

Some of the features that make React effective for both web and mobile development include:

*Cross-platform compatibility*: React's focus on reusable components and virtual DOM makes it possible to write code that works on both web and mobile platforms. This reduces development time and cost, and makes it easier to maintain code across multiple platforms.

*Third-party libraries and tools*: The React community has developed many third-party libraries and tools that can be used to build web and mobile applications. These tools include libraries for state management, routing, styling, testing, and more, which can help developers work more efficiently and effectively.

# Components
## Class Components:

In React, class-based components are a type of component that is defined using a JavaScript class. They are an older method of defining components, and have largely been replaced by functional components in modern React development. However, they are still commonly used in legacy code and in some specialized cases.

Class-based components are defined using the class keyword, and they extend the React.Component class. They define a render() method that returns a React element, which describes the UI that should be rendered to the screen.

Here is an example of a class-based component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class ExampleComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
> In this example, we define a class-based component called `ExampleComponent`. It extends the `React.Component` class and defines a `render`() method that returns a `div` element containing an `h1` element.

Class-based components have a few advantages over functional components, such as the ability to define state and lifecycle methods. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as being more verbose and harder to understand for beginners.

In general, functional components are preferred for modern React development, as they are easier to write and maintain, and provide better performance. However, class-based components are still a valuable tool in the React developer's toolbox, and can be useful in some specialized cases.

### what is constructor and super key word?
**constructor** are used for 2 purposes : <br>
In React class components to initialize the component's state and to bind event handlers.<br>

**super()** is used to call the constructor of its parent class. If we would like to set a property or access this inside the constructor we need to call super() method. 

> It is not necessary to have a constructor in every component.

> It is necessary to call super() within the constructor. To set property or use 'this' inside the constructor it is mandatory to call super().


### React Component with Constructor
```javascript

import React from 'react'; 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; 
class Main extends React.Component { 
  constructor() { 
    super(); 
    this.state = { 
      planet: "Earth" 
    } 
  } 
  render() { 
    return ( 
      < h1 >Hello {this.state.planet}!</h1> 
    ); 
  } 
} 
ReactDOM.render(<Main />, document.getElementById('root')); 
```
output:
```
Hello Earth          
```
<!-- In this example, we define a class-based component called `ExampleComponent`. We define a `constructor` method that calls the `super` method to initialize the component's `props` and sets the component's initial state to an object with two properties, `name` and `age`. We then use the `name` and `age` state properties in the `render` method to display a message on the screen. -->

This is a very basic example, but it demonstrates how the constructor and super keywords are used to initialize a React class component's state.

### React Component without Constructor 
```javascript
import React from 'react'; 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; 
class Main extends React.Component { 
  state = { 
    planet: "Mars" 
  } 
  render() { 
    return ( 
      < h1 >Hello {this.state.planet}!</h1> 
    ); 
  } 
} 
ReactDOM.render(<Main />, document.getElementById('root')); 
```
output:
```
Hello Mars! 
```

## Functional component
In React, function-based components are a newer and more lightweight way to define components than class-based components. They are defined using JavaScript functions and can be considered as pure functions that take in props and return a React element.

Here is an example of a function-based component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function ExampleComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this example, we define a function-based component called `ExampleComponent`. It takes in a `props` parameter, which is an object containing any props that are passed to the component. It returns a `div` element containing an `h1` element that displays the `name` prop.

Function-based components have several **advantages** over class-based components:

* They are simpler and more lightweight than class-based components, which makes them easier to read, write, and maintain.

* They are less verbose than class-based components, which means less boilerplate code.

* They are easier to test because they are just plain functions that take in props and return a React element.

* They are faster than class-based components, because they don't have the overhead of a class instance and lifecycle methods.

In summary, function-based components are a simpler and more lightweight way to define components in React. They are easier to read, write, and maintain, and provide better performance than class-based components. For these reasons, they have become the preferred way to define components in modern React development.

### Q. Is there any reason to still use react class components?

Yes, there are still some reasons to use React class components, although function components are now the preferred way of writing components in React.

Here are a few reasons why you might still choose to use React class components:

1. Legacy Codebase: If you are working on a legacy codebase that uses class components, it might be more efficient to continue using class components rather than rewriting all of your code.

2. Lifecycle Methods: React class components have access to a number of lifecycle methods that are not available to function components. If you need to use one of these lifecycle methods, such as componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate, you will need to use a class component.

3. More Explicit: Some developers prefer the more explicit nature of class components. With class components, everything is defined in one place, making it easier to see what's going on in your code.

That being said, function components are generally considered the better choice for new React projects, as they offer better performance, simpler syntax, and easier testing. However, there are still some cases where class components might be the better option.

## Functional component Vs Class component



|     | Functional Components |	Class Components |
| :---| :---------------------| :----------------|
|`Definition`|	Defined as a JavaScript function |	Defined as a JavaScript class|
|`Stat-Management` |	Uses useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods|	Uses state and lifecycle methods inside the class|
|`Props`|	Passed in as an argument to the function | Passed in as a property to the class|
|`Lifecycle-Methods`|	Uses useEffect hook to manage component lifecycle	|Has access to lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate|
|`Performance`|	Generally faster because they do not have to create an instance of the component|	Slightly slower because they have to create an instance of the component|

|`Code-Reusability`|	Can be easily reused in other components	|Cannot be easily reused in other components|
|`Testing`|	Easier to test because they are pure functions|	More difficult to test because they have state and lifecycle methods|
|`Refs`|	Cannot use refs directly inside the component|	Can use refs directly inside the component|


# State and Props
## State:
* In React, a "state" is an object that represents the internal data of a component. It is used to manage the component's dynamic behavior and to render the component with updated information.
* The data is passed within the components only.State can be modified. State can be used only in class component. 

* State can be changed by using the **setState()** method, which is provided by the React framework. When a component's state changes, React automatically re-renders the component with the updated information.

* State is typically used to handle user input, control component behavior, and store component-specific data.

* It's important to note that state is meant to be used only within the component it belongs to. It should not be passed down to child components as props, as this can make the code harder to maintain and debug.

## Props:
* React is a component-based library that divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.

* “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

* But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)

* Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

### Props in class component
In a class component in React, props can be accessed via the this.props object. Here's an example of how to use props in a class component:

*#Greeting.js*
```javascript
import React from 'react';

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}

export default Greeting;
```
In this example, the `Greeting` class extends React.Component and defines a `render` method that returns a greeting message with the value of the name `prop` passed to it.

When the Greeting component is used in another component, the name prop can be passed as an attribute, like this:

*#App.js*
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Greeting name="Alice" />
        <Greeting name="Bob" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
In this example, the App class extends React.Component and renders two instances of the Greeting component, each with a different name prop passed to it. When the Greeting component is rendered, it accesses the value of the name prop via this.props.name and uses it to render the greeting message.

### Props in functional component
Here's an example of how to use props in a functional component:

*#Greeting.js*
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```
In this example, the Greeting component is a simple functional component that receives a name prop and uses it to render a greeting message.

When the Greeting component is used in another component, the name prop can be passed as an attribute, like this:

*#App.js*

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Alice" />
      <Greeting name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `App` component is rendering two instances of the `Greeting` component, each with a different name prop. When the Greeting component is rendered, it will receive the name prop as an argument to its function, and the value of the name prop will be used to render the greeting message.

## Difference between State and Props

|Property|	State|	Props|
| :------| :-----| :-----|
|`Source`|	Defined and managed within a component|	Passed from a parent component to a child|
|`Mutability`|	Mutable and can be changed within a component	|Read-only and cannot be modified|
|`Ownership`|	Owned by the component that defines it|	Owned by the parent component|
|`Usage`|	Used to manage data within a component|	Used to pass data down the component tree|
|`Updates`|	Changes trigger a re-render of the component	|Changes trigger a re-render of the component|
|`DefaultValues`|	Must be initialized by the component itself	|Can have default values defined by the parent|
|`Scope`|	Should only be accessed and modified within component|	Can be accessed by child components|

## Update State and props using class component
1. Updating State:

* To update the state, you need to call the `setState` method.
* setState method accepts an object that contains the new values of the state properties you want to update.
* It's important to note that setState is asynchronous, so you should not rely on the current state or props values when updating state.
Here's an example:
```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
2. Updating Props:

* Props are read-only and cannot be directly modified by the component that receives them.
* However, you can pass new props to a component by re-rendering it with new prop values.
* To update props, you need to call the `setState` method of the parent component that passed the props to the child component.
* When the parent component updates its state, it triggers a re-render of the child component with the new prop values.
Here's an example:
```javascript
class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: "John",
    };
  }

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ name: "Mary" });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ChildComponent name={this.state.name} />
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Change Name</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>Hello {props.name}</p>;
}
```
In summary, to update state, you call the setState method with the new state values. To update props, you update the parent component's state, which triggers a re-render of the child component with the new prop values.

## Update State and props using functional component

1. Update State
* To update state in functional components, you need to use the useState hook provided by React.
* The useState hook returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function that can be used to update the state value.
* To update the state value, you call the function returned by the useState hook with the new state value.
Here's an example:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
2. Updating Props:

* Props are read-only and cannot be directly modified by the component that receives them, regardless of whether it is a functional component or a class component.
* To update props in functional components, you need to pass new prop values from the parent component.
* When the parent component updates its state, it triggers a re-render of the child component with the new prop values.
Here's an example:
```javascript
import React from "react";

function ParentComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("John");

  const handleClick = () => {
    setName("Mary");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent name={name} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Change Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>Hello {props.name}</p>;
}
```
In summary, to update state in functional components, you use the useState hook to update the state value. To update props, you pass new prop values from the parent component.

### >How to pass data from parent to child? 
In React, you can pass data from a parent component to a child component using props. 

*#Parent Component:*

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent() {
  const data = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 25,
    city: 'New York',
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```
*#Child Component:*

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function ChildComponent(props) {
  const { data } = props;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {data.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {data.age}</p>
      <p>City: {data.city}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
export default ChildComponent;
```
In this example, the ParentComponent passes the data object to the ChildComponent as a prop. The ChildComponent then receives the data object as a prop, and can access its properties using dot notation (data.name, data.age, data.city) within the function body.


## Conditional Rendering
* Conditional rendering is a technique in React that allows you to render different content or components based on certain conditions. 
* It's a powerful way to make your components more dynamic and responsive to user input.

```javascript

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [showText, setShowText] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setShowText(!showText);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Toggle Text</button>
      {showText && <p>Some text to show when button is clicked</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
export default Example;
```
* In this example, we use the useState hook to create a boolean state variable called `showText`. The initial value is false, which means the text won't be shown initially.

* We also define a function called `handleClick` that toggles the value of `showText` between true and false.

* In the return statement, we render a button with an `onClick` event listener that calls handleClick when clicked. 
* We also use a conditional statement to render the text only when `showText` is true. If `showText` is false, the text won't be rendered.

* When the user clicks the button, the handleClick function is called, which toggles the value of showText. This causes the component to re-render, and the text will be shown or hidden based on the new value of showText.

Note that the conditional statement used here is a shorthand way to write an if statement. The expression { showText && `<p>`Some text to show when button is clicked`</p>` } means "if showText is true, render the `<p>` element; otherwise, render nothing".

**There are several techniques for performing conditional rendering in React:**

1. If statements: You can use regular if statements to conditionally render content. For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent(props) {
  if (props.isLoggedIn) {
    return <p>Welcome back!</p>;
  } else {
    return <p>Please log in.</p>;
  }
}
```
2. Ternary operator: You can use a ternary operator to create a more concise if/else statement. For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.isMember ? <p>Welcome, member!</p> : <p>Please sign up.</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```
3. Logical && operator: You can use the logical && operator to conditionally render content. For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.hasData &&
        <ul>
          {props.data.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
        </ul>
      }
    </div>
  );
}
```
4. Switch statement: If you have multiple conditions to check, you can use a switch statement to conditionally render content. For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent(props) {
  switch (props.status) {
    case 'loading':
      return <p>Loading...</p>;
    case 'error':
      return <p>Error: {props.errorMessage}</p>;
    case 'success':
      return <p>Success!</p>;
    default:
      return null;
  }
}
```

# Life Cycle Methods:

In React, lifecycle methods are special methods that allow you to perform actions at specific stages in a component's lifecycle. These methods are called automatically by React at different points in the component's life.

There are three phases in the React component lifecycle: mounting, updating, and unmounting. Each of these phases has its own set of lifecycle methods.
1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from
The phase covers initialization from
* constructor()
* render()
* componentDidMount()
2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated by, sending the new props and updating the state from setState()
This phase covers initialization From
The phase covers initialization from
* shouldComponentUpdate()
* render()
* componentDidUpdate()
3. **Unmounting:** In this phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM.
The phase covers initialization from
* componentWillUnmount()

## Mounting:
The mounting means to put elements into the DOM. React uses virtual DOM to put all the elements into the memory. It has four built-in methods to mount a component namely.
1. Constructor()
2. render()
3. componentDidMount()

**Constructor()**
method is called when the component is initiated and it’s the best place to initialize our state. The constructor method takes props as an argument and starts by calling super(props) before anything else.
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class App extends Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: 'Constructor Method'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
       <p> This is a {this.state.name}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
**render()**
* The render() function does not modify the component state, it returns the same result each time it’s invoked and is
responsible for describing the view to be rendered to the browser window.
* render() is called by React at various app stages, generally when the React component is first instantiated, or when there is a new update to the component state.

> Note : render() will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.

**componentDidMount()**
The most common and widely used lifecycle method is componentDidMount. This method is called after the component is rendered.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class componentDidMountMethod extends Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: 'This name will change in 5 sec'
    }
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({name: "This is a componentDidMount Method"})
    }, 5000)

  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
       <p>{this.state.name}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
output:
```
This is a componentDidMount Method 
```
The above example will print This is a componentDidMount Method after 5 sec. This proves that the method is called after the component is rendered.

## Updating
This is the second phase of the React lifecycle. A component is updated when there is a change in state and props React basically has five built-in methods that are called while updating the components.
1. shouldComponentUpdate()
2. render()
3. componentDidUpdate()

**shouldComponentUpdate()**
 is used when you want your state or props to update or not. This method returns a boolean value that specifies whether rendering should be done or not. The default value is true.
 ```javascript
 import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class shouldComponentUpdateMethod extends Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: 'shouldComponentUpdate Method'
    }
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate() {
    return false; //Change to true for state to update
  }

  componentDidMount(){
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({name: "componentDidMount Method"})
    }, 5000)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
       <p>This is a {this.state.name}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
**componentDidUpdate** method is called after the component is updated in the DOM. This is the best place in updating the DOM in response to the change of props and state.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class componentDidUpdateMethod extends Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props)
        this.state = {
            name: 'from previous state'
        }
    }
    componentDidMount(){
        setTimeout(() => {
            this.setState({name: "to current state"})
          }, 5000)
    }
    componentDidUpdate(prevState){
        if(prevState.name !== this.state.name){
            document.getElementById('statechange').innerHTML = "Yes the state is changed"
        }
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                State was changed {this.state.name}
                <p id="statechange"></p>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```
