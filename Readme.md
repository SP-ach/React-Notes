# REACT NOTES 

## What is React.JS?

* React.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and has been widely adopted by the web development community for its simplicity, speed, and flexibility.

* In a nutshell, React allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be combined to form complex user interfaces. Each component encapsulates its own logic and state, making it easier to reason about the behavior of the application.

* React is based on a concept called the **virtual DOM**, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). When a user interacts with a React component, the virtual DOM is updated to reflect the changes, and then React efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM to reflect those changes. This results in better performance and a smoother user experience.

* React also uses a declarative programming model, meaning that you describe what you want your UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM accordingly. This is in contrast to an imperative programming model, where you have to manually manipulate the DOM to achieve the desired result.

* Finally, React can be used with other popular front-end libraries and frameworks, such as Redux for managing state and React Router for routing. It also has a large and active community, which provides helpful resources and support for developers.
